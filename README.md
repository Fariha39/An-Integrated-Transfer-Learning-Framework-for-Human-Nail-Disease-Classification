# An Integrated Transfer Learning for Human Nail Disease Classification

## üìö Description  
This project implements an integrated transfer learning approach for **Human Nail Disease Classification** using various pre-trained models. The models used in this project include **VGG16**, **VGG19**, **DenseNet121**, and a **Hybrid Model** combining **DenseNet121** with **SoftAttention** to improve classification accuracy.

### Objective:
- To classify human nail diseases using transfer learning.
- Explore and compare the performance of different pre-trained models.
- Propose a hybrid model that combines **DenseNet121** with **SoftAttention** to enhance classification accuracy.

## üß† Models Used:
1. **VGG16** - A deep convolutional neural network architecture.
2. **VGG19** - A variant of VGG16 with more layers.
3. **DenseNet121** - A model based on dense connections between layers.
4. **Hybrid Model** - A custom hybrid model that combines **DenseNet121** with **SoftAttention** to capture important features.

## üîß Requirements
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **OpenCV** (if needed for image processing)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (optional for visualization)
